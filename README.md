# zk-Election

zk-Election is a cryptography-driven, privacy-preserving election framework that leverages the power of zk-SNARKs (Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge). It ensures secure and transparent voting while maintaining voter anonymity and data privacy, making it ideal for decentralized election systems.

## Features

### Privacy-Preserving Framework
Ensures voter confidentiality by leveraging zk-SNARKs with the Groth16 proving system, allowing secure election outcomes without revealing sensitive data.

### Efficient Zero-Knowledge Proofs
Advanced circuits written in Circom enable efficient proof generation for anonymous voting while ensuring verifiability and scalability.

### On-Chain Verification
Seamless integration of SnarkJS and Solidity for deploying a custom verifier.sol contract, ensuring robust cryptographic security and minimal gas costs for verifying zk-SNARK proofs.

### Decentralized Workflow
Designed a decentralized election workflow with a Next.js-powered frontend, showcasing cryptographic guarantees such as:
- Non-Repudiation: Votes cannot be denied by the voter once cast.
- Anonymity: Preserves voter identities while ensuring vote validity.
- Tamper-Proof Records: Guarantees secure and immutable voting records.

### üõ°Ô∏è Trustless and Transparent
Eliminates the need for trust by applying cutting-edge zk-SNARK protocols, ensuring election transparency, integrity, and security.
